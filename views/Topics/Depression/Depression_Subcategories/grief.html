NLP Techniques and the grieving

It is natural that we grieve for a short period of time in order to come to terms with our loss. My parents died many years ago.

I was very close to both of them and of course I grieved when they had gone.

Very many years later I think of one or both of them almost every day, but I am no longer grieving.

It would have helped me even more at the time if I knew some of the NLP techniques that I now know.

I sometimes wonder what they would have done in a given situation, imagine how they would have reacted to the more recent additions to our family or remember the very many happy times we had together.

The memories arehappy and positive ones.

Now is not the time for recrimination or to think “if only”; it is the moment to cherish the happy memories.

What is not natural or healthy, however, is when perhaps three or four years on someone is still grieving and cannot move forward.

The griever is still making bad pictures in his or her mind.

What is more, the pictures are big, they are usually of the worst moments (perhaps lying dreadfully sick and suffering in a hospital bed), the pictures are played over and over again and the grief just gets worse.
