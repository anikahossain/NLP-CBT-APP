THE CONSCIOUS MIND
<br>
<br>


 Why should we bother to "think positively?" Based on much published
 information, many people have benefited from positive thinking.
 And those of us who have consciously tried it have found it to be
 worthwhile.
 But how does it work--and how much of the success of positive thinking
 is a result of the Conscious mind?

<br>
<br>

 You may already know your conscious awareness has a restricted capacity
 for retaining information. Research has shown we can hold 7 plus
 or minus 2 chunks of information in awareness at any one time.
 Techniques
 for helping people with their memory often vary the size of the chunks,
 or find ways to link small chunks into one larger chunk to allow more
 memory
 capacity. This is why telephone numbers are broken into three and four
 digit sections.
<br>
<br>

THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND

<br>
<br>

 So what else is happening behind the 7 plus or minus 2 chunks of
 information
 in our conscious thinking? What organises our heartbeat, our digestion,
 our response to outside temperature? What allows us to drive our
 car without having to think about it? What receives literally billions
 of pieces of external information, and processes them with no effort?
<br>
<br>


 Psychologists refer to this part of the mind as the Unconscious, or
 more
 accurately, the Other-Than-Conscious, because it is far from
 unconscious.
 It is awake and active even when we are asleep. Doctors were surprised
 to discover that, under hypnosis, patients who had been anaesthetised
 were able to recall every word said in the operating theatre. One
 part of their mind was obviously fully aware of what was going on!

<br>
<br>

 The brain looks after thousands of functions in the body every moment,
 and can handle astronomic amounts of information. What is most
 impressive
 is it can do all of these things at the same time without any need for
 conscious control. And fortunately, it never forgets how.

<br>
<br>

 The Unconscious responds to every external stimuli, and every thought.
 Each response sets off a chemical reaction which is sent to the rest of
 the body. Therefore WHAT we think takes on a vital significance.
 The Unconscious is like a good assistant, and basically it will do what
 you tell it. But what exactly are you telling it to do?

<br>
<br>

 You may say, "I deserve the very best," but if in your Unconscious
 the message is being countered with,"You?...You'll never amount to
 anything,"
 what is going to be the result?
<br>
<br>


 Unless you stop and think about it, you will be unaware of the
 Unconscious
 thought. All that you will probably be aware of is a slight sense
 of unease or something not being quite right An internal conflict
 may result and this will lead to incongruent behaviour. This
 explains why saying an affirmation, or positive statement about
 yourself,
 sometimes does not work.

<br>
<br>

 NLP has techniques and strategies to help you become fully congruent.
 Congruence is when you align your mind and behaviour behind positive
 thoughts
 so there is total commitment to achieving an outcome. This
 is important because as Anthony Robbins says, "It is in your moments of
 decision that your destiny is shaped." A good way to experience
 congruence
 is to utilise past positive experiences and incorporate these into
 present
 behaviour. The result is new and empowered ways of thinking.


<br>
<br>
 We each have ten billion neurons (brain cells). And there are more
 potential simultaneous connections between neurons than there are atoms
 in the known universe. Yes, you may need to read that again!
 This means we have an almost infinite capacity for creativity and
 problem
 solving. As Einstein pointed out, the ONLY way we limit ourselves
 is by not fully utilising this amazing gift. NLP is designed to help
 us access more neurological pathways and thereby create more choice in
 our life.


<br>
<br>
 To experience NLP and find your own states of congruence, try the
 "Circles
 of Excellence" exercise in the panel accompanying this article.
<br>
<br>

POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES
<br>
<br>


 We continually use negative ideas to express ourselves -- Don't turn
 right.
 Stop Smoking. Don't think negatively. These statements make
 our point consciously, but how are these innocent messages being
 received
 at the Unconscious level?


<br>
<br>
 Try this little experiment:
 Don't think of blue dancing frogs.

<br>
<br>

 What happened? You had to think of blue dancing frogs, and THEN use
 your own personal strategy to somehow negate the thought. In other
 words, every time you use a negative your brain is first registering
 the
 exact opposite of what you mean.

<br>
<br>

 We met a friend the other day with a broken toe and asked her what
 happened.
 She replied, "I was shopping and had just picked up a tin of paint when
 a salesperson said, 'Careful, don't drop it on your foot.'
 A few moments later, the paint slipped out of my hands." The
 Unconscious
 processed the helpful salesperson's message as "Drop it on your foot --
 Don't," and she followed the initial command to the letter!
<br>
<br>


 Think how often children are disciplined with negatives. Don't fall.
 Don't touch that. Don't ...Don't...Don't. Sometimes what may
 seem like disobeying could just be their Unconscious processing the
 experience of falling or touching. Have you ever thought, "I don't want
 to fail," "I don't want to be in this job all my life," "I must not
 miss this sale"? Think about it...by the time your brain has got
 to the "don't" or "must not," your whole body has already received the
 message: fail, stay in the job, miss the sale.


<br>
<br>
 So if you want to think positively, the key question to ask yourself
 is:
 "If I don't want "X", what do I want in its place?"

<br>
<br>
BE SPECIFIC


<br>
<br>
 Answering this question precisely gives your brain something to work
 toward.
 The more you can specify what you will see, hear and feel the more the
 brain is given a map to create new solutions and guide it to its
 outcome.

<br>
<br>

 So, if you find yourself thinking something like, "I don't want to be
 nervous
 in front of a group," ask yourself, "what would I be doing instead?"
 You might answer "I will have steady hands, breathe easily, feel
 relaxed
 in my stomach, make eye contact, have a clear voice, be humorous,
 etc. etc." The more detail, and the more specific you are, the better.

<br>
<br>

 More information about how you can use NLP to be specific in your
 thinking
 is available in Sue Harley's article "Achieving That Change You Really
 Want" in last month's issue of "Personal Success."

<br>
<br>
TOWARD AND AWAY FROM

<br>
<br>

 In order for you to be effective, your brain not only needs a specific
 goal, it also needs a DIRECTION to achieve that goal. If it does
 not have a direction it wanders randomly, avoiding what you don't want,
 but not going anywhere in particular. You can aim in a specified
 direction
 and maintain that course, or you can say, 'Que c'est ra, c'est ra' --
 and indeed, whatever will be will be--but it will be outside of your
 control.
<br>
<br>


 One way to get used to moving in a desired direction is to continually
 ask yourself "What do I have to do NEXT to achieve my goal?" As far as
 the Unconscious mind is concerned, the goal is like a map. The
 direction
 is like a compass. You need both to navigate successfully. Strategies
 for motivation use the mind's ability to move you toward what you want,
 and move you away from what you don't want.

<br>
<br>
MOTIVATIONAL STRATEGIES
<br>
<br>

Away
 from Failure
 ----->----->----->----->----->
 Toward Success
<br>
<br>

 How do you motivate yourself? Are you moving away from failure, and
 thinking how much you don't want poverty, boredom, or embarrassment?
 Or are you motivated by, and moving toward success and thinking of
 healthy relationships, accomplishment, financial security?

<br>
<br>

 Keep in mind moving away from and moving toward are both useful
 motivation
 strategies. For example, moving away from a dangerous situation is a
 very
 healthy thing to do. However, if this is the ONLY way you motivate
 yourself, then you are likely to be suffering from an abundance of
 anxiety
 and stress.

<br>
<br>

 Given your understanding now of how the Unconscious works, you will
 realise
 the value of having a strong towards motivator. Studies of highly
 effective
 people show that, in fact, they utilise BOTH moving away from and
 moving
 towards simultaneously. Not only does this double the motivation
 power, it is also setting a very clear direction.

<br>
<br>

 Thirty years ago Martin Luther King wanted to strongly move away from
 oppression
 and toward his dream of a society where all people are treated equal.
 By
 setting a very clear direction he motivated millions to change the
 course
 of American history.
