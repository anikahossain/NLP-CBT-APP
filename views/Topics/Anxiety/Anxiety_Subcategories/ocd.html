<p class="center-align ocd">In CBT the person with OCD will explore alternative meanings or beliefs about the intrusive thoughts and rituals in all their guises (for example washing, checking, writing lists, tapping, touching, repeating, cleaning, trying to get a ‘just right’ feeling, praying)  and will learn what it is that ultimately keeps alive the meanings they attach to such thoughts and rituals.
<br>
<br>
So during the first few sessions a good therapist should spend time making sense of how the OCD works and what keeps it going. The idea and reason behind this is that if we can understand the factors that keep a problem alive, we can then take the next step, which is to think about alternative ways of viewing the problem and what we can then do to change it.
<br>
<br>
Therefore in CBT we look at how OCD convinces you that the rituals and compulsions performed are necessary, in order to prevent something bad happening.  If such a bad outcome were to be true as a result of the thought, the sufferer would be convinced it was entirely their fault and responsibility. We also look at the possibility that OCD is a liar. All the sufferer's coping strategies have come about in the first place to make them feel safer and less anxious, when in fact they do the exact opposite, they make the person feel unsafe and scared. Even if they provide temporary relief from anxiety, all these rituals make the meaning attached to those intrusive thoughts, images, urges and doubts feel even stronger, therefore it becomes necessary for the sufferer to keep doing the rituals continuously.   Ultimately this makes the thoughts seem even more real, and like there is even more truth in them.
<br>
<br>
The cyclical nature of the problem can be illustrated by drawing a diagram of how it works - we sometimes call it the ‘vicious flower’ – one of Professor Paul Salkovskis’s diagrams shows the general idea.

<br>
So how do we deal with all these rituals? Here are some common ones, along with an idea of possible ways we might tackle them in CBT:
<br>
<br>
For example, if the OCD problem is checking , the sufferer might be asked to try ‘behavioural experiments’ to find out what happens when they don’t check.  A key stage in the evolution of CBT was the development of ‘Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)’ which involves being exposed to whatever it is that makes a person feel anxious, without checking or carrying out other rituals.   CBT then goes beyond this, by using what we call ‘behavioural experiments’ which find out what happens when a sufferer doesn't check or perform their rituals.  Rather than just riding out their anxiety in the feared situation (as in ERP), it goes further by testing out the sufferer's belief that they could ultimately be responsible for harm by not checking or performing their rituals. The therapist will always acknowledge that there is a risk that something bad will happen if the sufferer doesn’t check, but it is the perception of the level of risk that ultimately drives the OCD, by magnifying it to be greater than it actually is.  The one guarantee is that with continued checking the OCD will always remain a problem.
<br>
<br>
OCD also often tells people to avoid all sorts of things (for example public toilets, children’s playgrounds, people with diseases etc), but by avoiding such situations the sufferer never has the chance to find out what really would happen. So in CBT, people are asked to consider doing the opposite to avoiding the situation (for example if OCD has made a person believe that they are at risk of dying from contamination from germs – in treatment the therapist and patient might put their hands down the toilet). This behavioural experiment allows the person to find evidence for themselves about whether OCD has been lying and  whether they have been needlessly avoiding situations for no reason at all.
