Neuro-Linguistic Programming is popular in the field of personal development and self-motivation, and its potential for teaching and learning is gaining recognition, too.
<br>
<br>
Said to be highly congruent to Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences, two neuro-linguistic programming techniques, perceptual positioning and presupposition, are deemed useful in solving problems encountered in teaching.
<br>
<br>
Perceptual positioning is the ability to see things from the point of view of another, a way to understand people better. This process can be used in negotiation and interviewing, as well as to promote healthy boundaries and self-concept. It encourages “putting oneself in another’s shoes”, and thus can be applied to help with bullying and behavioral problems.
<br>
<br>
Presupposition relates to unspoken meanings in conversation. For example, when a teacher offers the learner a choice between taking a quiz now or finishing the lecture first, the message that both tasks must be done is clear although not directly uttered that way. Giving the learner this ability to make a choice allows them to focus on their decision “rather than challenging the teacher’s instructions”.
<br>
<br>
A paper submitted at the European Conference on Educational Research presents a discussion on how the neuro-linguistic programming approach is useful to teaching and learning. Among the many parallels mentioned between teaching and neuro-linguistic programming techniques are the following:
<br>
<br>
In a dynamic teacher-learner relationship, meaning is achieved through mutual feedback.
All communication potentially influences learning. Teachers’ language and behavior crucially influence learners on at least two levels: Their understanding of the topic in question and their beliefs about the world, including about learning.
Teachers’ awareness of their behavior and choice of words, and how sensitive they are to the influence of such words and behavior on learners, are vital to making the teaching and learning processes effective.
According to this helpful article from the British Council website, the state of congruence in neuro-linguistic programming is believed to help with language fluency, as it suggests that teaching non-verbal communication in conjunction with phonology and functional language produces better language learning results.
<br>
<br>
In language teaching, the ways students learn and better process information (visual, auditory, or kinesthetic) are affected by elements that find practical uses in learning in general:
<br>
<br>
1. Deletion.
<br>
<br>
As learners deal with a barrage of information, they omit some information to manage input better.
<br>
<br>
2. Distortion.
<br>
<br>
Language learners distort new information into easily understandable forms. Albeit prone to errors and misunderstandings, this process enables students to devise their own unique way to absorb the lessons.
<br>
<br>
3. Generalization.
<br>
<br>
Drawing broad conclusions from the information at hand is also one way to learn, as long as over-generalizations that result in the misapplication of certain rules are dealt with accordingly.
<br>
<br>
Aside from techniques that include storytelling, simulation, and role plays, the following neuro-linguistic programming methodologies are now being employed loosely in different learning environments:
<br>
<br>
1. Anchoring.
<br>
<br>
This method focuses on an external trigger or stimulus that elicits a positive emotional response. Teachers use this technique through the introduction of keywords or sounds to create an anchor that, consciously or subconsciously, helps students subsequently recall the material.
<br>
<br>
2. Maintaining Flow.
<br>
<br>
This technique indicates that "best learning takes place when uninterrupted". The teacher creates competitive and collaborative challenges, and customizes them according to a learner’s personality to bridge information gap and maintain flow.
<br>
<br>
3. Pacing And Leading.
<br>
<br>
This technique is a powerful communication and persuasion tool that uses strategies such as mirroring and stating facts to build rapport and get students to agree with the teacher.
