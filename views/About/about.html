<h5 class="center-align">What is NLP?</h4>
<p class="center-align">NLP is a method of influencing brain behaviour (the "neuro" part of the phrase) through the use of language (the "linguistic" part) and other types of communication to enable a person to "recode" the way the brain responds to stimuli (that's the "programming") and manifest new and better behaviours. Neuro-Linguistic Programming often incorporates hypnosis and self-hypnosis to help achieve the change (or "programming") that is wanted.</p>
<h5 class="center-align">What is CBT?</h4>
<p class="center-align">CBT is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy treatment that takes a hands-on, practical approach to problem-solving. Its goal is to change patterns of thinking or behavior that are behind peopleâ€™s difficulties, and so change the way they feel.</p>
