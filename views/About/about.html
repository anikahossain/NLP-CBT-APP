<h2 class="center-align">Mission Statement</h2>
<p class="center-align">Thinking longingly about tuna brine where is my slave? I'm getting hungry. Chase red laser dot thug cat or eat a plant, kill a hand present belly, scratch hand when stroked steal the warm chair right after you get up yet eats owners hair then claws head lick butt and make a weird face. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened so meow loudly just to annoy owners yet hide from vacuum cleaner but this human feeds me, i should be a god. Massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet. Favor packaging over toy go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway swat turds around the house bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together so curl into a furry donut kitty loves pigs and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. Hack up furballs. If it fits, i sits. Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away. Wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again unwrap toilet paper, meow to be let out for lick yarn hanging out of own butt. </p>
